    <h2>Plants Make A Happy Betta Fish</h2>
    Betta fish do best in a planted tank. A planted tank requires a substrate (dirt) in which the plants roots will grow. Plants in a fish tank are generally categorized into three categories: carpts (also known as forground), midground, and background.

    <h3> Carpets </h3>

    <p> Carpet plants are short and typically placed at the front of the tank.

    <h3> Midground </h3>

    <p> Midground plants are taller than the carpet but shorter than the background plants.</p>

    <h3> Background </h3>

    <p> The background plants are the tallest in the tank - often being nearly as tall as the tank itself. They are typically placed at the back.</p>
